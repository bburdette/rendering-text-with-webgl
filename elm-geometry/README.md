# elm-geometry [![Travis build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ianmackenzie/elm-geometry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ianmackenzie/elm-geometry)

_Note: I am in currently in the process of moving [`opensolid/geometry`](https://github.com/opensolid/geometry)
to this repository, so continue to use [the `opensolid/geometry` package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/opensolid/geometry/latest) until
`ianmackenzie/elm-geometry` has been published. All new development will happen
here though!_
